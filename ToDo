Umm. I see what you mean. It's reasonable to assume that a driver
will 'freeze' the value of applicable attributes at prepare or execute
time. The driver should probably document that kind of thing.

I think the DBI's template .xst file will probably grow some code
to handle attributes to prepare semi-automatically, sometime.
